#About

FOSSASIA 2014 is an exciting Open Technology event for developers, students, and start ups using open source to build up their businesses. It is a unique opportunity to share the latest innovations in open source technologies and meet contributors and potential partners. FOSSASIA 2014 will take place for the first time in Cambodia. It will be held at [Norton University](http://norton-u.com/en/) in Phnom Penh from February 28 - March 2. FOSSASIA 2014 will focus on the use of open technologies in sustainable development in order to improve the lives and conditions of those living in poverty.


Since the first FOSSASIA meetup in 2009 in Ho Chi Minh City, FOSSASIA has taken the lead to organize Free and Open Source Software conferences in Vietnam. Past FOSSASIA events have attracted over 1400 participants and speakers from 24 countries, with more than 100 volunteers. More than half of all participants were women.

FOSSASIA is an organization developing software applications for social change using a wide-range of technologies. It was established in 2009. Projects range from Free and Open Source software, to design, graphics and hardware. We also organize and participate in conferences, meetups and code camps. The annual FOSSASIA OpenTechSummit is one of the largest gatherings of developers in Asia and took place in Vietnam, Cambodia and Singapore. Please join us and start contributing to our projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/fossasia.org).

##FOSSASIA Activities
