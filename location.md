#Location, Visa and Accomodation in Phnom Penh
Phnom Penh (/pəˈnɔːm ˈpɛn/ or /ˈnɒm ˈpɛn/;Khmer: ភ្នំពេញ, Khmer pronunciation: [pnum pɨɲ]) is the capital and largest city of Cambodia. Located on the banks of the Tonlé Sap and Mekong River, Phnom Penh has been the national capital since French colonization of Cambodia, and has grown to become the nation's center of economic and industrial activities, as well as the center of security, politics, cultural heritage, and diplomacy of Cambodia.

Once known as the "Pearl of Asia," it was considered one of the loveliest French-built cities in Indochina in the 1920s. Phnom Penh, along with Siem Reap and Sihanoukville, are significant global and domestic tourist destinations for Cambodia. Founded in 1434, the city is noted for its beautiful and historical architecture and attractions. There are a number of surviving French colonial buildings scattered along the grand boulevards.

Situated on the banks of the Tonlé Sap, Mekong and Bassac rivers, the Phnom Penh metropolitan area is home to about 2.2 million of Cambodia's population of over 14.8 million, up from about 1.9 million in 2008. The city is the wealthiest and most populous city in Cambodia and is the country's political hub.

##History

In 1975 Phnom Penh was choked with up to 2 million refugees from the war between the then U.S.-backed government and the Khmer Rouge. The city fell to the Khmer Rouge in 1975, who completely emptied it of civilians and allowed it to crumble for several years. The city's small class of skilled or educated professionals was systematically murdered by Pol Pot, or driven into exile. Cambodia's developing economy and institutionalised corruption have concentrated wealth into a new rich class that now supports Phnom Penh's new fancy hotels and restaurants. Increasing tourist numbers are also bringing about improving tourist infrastructure.

##Orientation

All of Phnom Penh's streets are numbered. Some major thoroughfares also have names. The scheme is simple: odd-numbered streets run north-south, the numbers increasing as you head west from the river, and even numbered streets run west-east, increasing as you head south (with some exceptions, e.g., the west side of what was Boeung Kak Lake).

House numbers, however, are quite haphazard. Don't expect houses to be numbered sequentially on a street; you might even find two completely unrelated houses with the same number on the same street.

##Visa

VISA: Right upon arrival at Phnom Penh International Airport, you can buy a 1-month tourist visa for $25. 2 passport pictures are needed (or some cash). ATM available. Make sure your passport is valid at least another six months. From the airport, take a taxi or tuk tuk ride to the conference location or your hotel for $9 or $7 (taxi or tuk tuk respectively, flat rate for single trips from the airport to any point of the city).

Business Visas are the best choice for those wishing to stay for over two months with multiple entries, as a business visa can be extended indefinitely (approximately US$140 per 6 month extension and US$285 per 12 month extension) and have multiple entry status when (and only when) extended. For faster and reliable processing of your long term Business Visa application, it is advisable to contact reliable and reputable travel agents who have better knowledge and understanding of the system for prompt visa application processing and delivery.
